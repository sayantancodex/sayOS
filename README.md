Operating System


üîß About sayOS:
sayOS is a lightweight and efficient Linux distribution designed to support all terminal tasks and basic graphics support. Here are some key features:

- Terminal-Centric Design: sayOS is optimized for terminal use, providing a robust environment for coding, scripting, and other development tasks.
- Basic GUI: The graphical user interface is intentionally minimalistic, with a resolution of 800x600. It is built using open-source plugins like Openbox and Ly, ensuring a lightweight and responsive experience.
- Integrated Browser: Despite its minimalist design, sayOS includes a Firefox browser for essential web browsing. However, due to the low graphics support, it‚Äôs not suitable for graphically intensive tasks.

üîç Technical Details:

- Kernel: The kernel of sayOS is based on Ubuntu 10. While this older kernel served as a solid foundation for my project, it is currently unsupported and has several bugs. As a result, sayOS is not suitable for regular, day-to-day use but serves as an excellent proof of concept and learning tool.

üí° Challenges & Learnings:
The journey of creating sayOS was filled with numerous challenges and invaluable lessons. Here are some of the key takeaways from this project:

1. Kernel Limitations: Working with an unsupported and outdated kernel like Ubuntu 10 presented significant challenges. The lack of support and updates made debugging and optimization more difficult, but it also forced me to dive deeper into the intricacies of kernel development and maintenance.
2. GUI Development: Crafting a basic GUI using open-source plugins like Openbox and Ly was both a challenging and rewarding experience. Balancing functionality with a lightweight design required careful consideration and a lot of tweaking.
3. Browser Integration: Integrating Firefox into sayOS was essential to provide basic web browsing capabilities. Ensuring it functioned smoothly with limited graphics support was a notable challenge, but it enhanced my understanding of browser optimization and system resource management.
4. Persistence and Problem-Solving: Developing sayOS demanded a high level of persistence and problem-solving skills. Each obstacle, from kernel bugs to GUI limitations, provided a learning opportunity that enriched my knowledge of Linux systems and open-source software.
